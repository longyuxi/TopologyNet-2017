# A repository for reproducing TopologyNet 2017 paper

A reproduction of the TopologyNet-BP from *TopologyNet: Topology based deep convolutional and multi-task neural networks for biomolecular property predictions* by Zixuan Cang, Guo-Wei Wei. [Paper link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005690)

1. Start with the `ph` directory to calculate the 24 different persistent homology features.

2. Then use the `ml` directory to use the TopologyNet neural network architecture.

## A note on commits:

(When I remember to do so)

The commits where I run some slightly modified model and then upload the results will have names starting with "R:", which stands for "run" or "research".
