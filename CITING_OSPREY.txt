All works in this repository are part of PATH, which is part of the open-source protein redesign software suite OSPREY. We ask that users of this repository cite the following papers, and also mention the name OSPREY, when presenting results from or extensions to OSPREY in papers, patents, and conference presentations. OSPREY relies on grants for its development, and to get grants it's essential for the impacts of OSPREY to be visible in the scientific literature.
